Your breath blows my
hair in this crowded space
It stinks all the time
because you’re older
You smoke everytime
You will be critically ill
I wish you live longer longer
Work hard all day long
You must take a rest
Feeling, want to cry
Lost your honor
Mom always read it to me
and go to sleep early
Need to remember over and over
-
We can live forever
We just live forever
We can sleep forever
We just sleep forever
Work hard all day long
You must take a rest
Feeling, want to cry
Lost your honor
Mom always read it to me
and go to sleep early
Need to remember over and over
We can live forever
We just live forever
We can sleep forever
We just sleep forever
